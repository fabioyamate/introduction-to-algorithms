LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)
  for i = 1 to A.length
    if A[i] == v
      return i
  return NIL

Initialization:
  before the loop, we always point to an untested value with position `i`

Maintenance:
  we check if the value `v` is equal to the current pointing value `A[i]`,
  if so we return the index `i`, otherwise the index `i` is incremented
  keeping the invariant of an untested value

Termination:
  if the loop ends it means that we didn't find the value in A, which
  means that we return NIL value
