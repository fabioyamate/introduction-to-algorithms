\textbf{2-1 Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort}

\textbf{a.} Show that insertion sort can sort the n=k sublists, each of length k, in ‚.nk/ worst-case time.

\textbf{Answer}

Given worst-case of INSERTION-SORT is $f(n) = an^2 + bn + c$, to sort $n/k$ sublists of length
$k$ the worst-case is $n/kf(k)$ so:

\begin{equation*}
  T(n) = \frac{n}{k} f(k) = \frac{n}{k} (ak^2 + bk + c) = ank + bn + c \implies \implies \Theta (nk)
\end{equation*}

\textbf{b.} Show how to merge the sublists in‚ $\Theta (n \lg(n/k))$ worst-case time.

\textbf{Answer}

Considering that $2^i = n/k$ is the number of leaves, so the number of recursions tree is $i = \lg (n/k)$.
For each recursion level, it was proved that it takes $cn$, so the worst-case is

\begin{equation*}
  cn \lg (n/k) \implies \Theta (n \lg (n/k)) q.e.d.
\end{equation*}

\textbf{c.} Given that the modified algorithm runs in, $\Theta (nk + n \lg (n/k))$ worst-case time,
what is the largest value of $k$ as a function of $n$ for which the modified algorithm has the same
running time as standard merge sort, in terms of‚ $\Theta$-notation?

\textbf{Answer}

...

\textbf{d.} How should we choose $k$ in practice?

\textbf{Answer}

We should choose $k$ based on statistics input, because the average case of inputs might not
be always the worst-case time. So, it is possible that in practice the $k$ has a different
value.
