Instance of a problem
  inputs required to compute a solution to the problem

Correct Algorithm
  for every input it halts with the corret output
  it solves the computation problem

Data Structure
  store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modification

NP-Complete
  subset of problems that no efficient solution is known
  proposition: if there is a efficient NP-complete problem, then there is
               an efficient solution for every NP-complete problem.
